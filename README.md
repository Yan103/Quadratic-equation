
# The solver of quadratic equations

A unique program that can solve quadratic (and not only) equations. The program was written in the C programming language during the summer school under the guidance of the best mentor - Yaroslav ðŸ˜Ž
The program requests 3 numbers - the coefficients of the equation and outputs the result to the console. It is also possible to pass arguments through the command console:
```bash
-h calls the help commands
-t starts the automatic testing mode (by reading data from a file)
-s starts the input coefficients mode for solving equation (enabled by default)
-a {number} limited input mode for {number} attempts
```

## Installation and assembly
To run the program on your computer, download the repository and run the Makefile
1. Cloning a repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yan103/Quadratic-equation
```
2. Compilation of source files
```bash
make
```
3. Start (in solver mode)
```bash
make run
```
4. Optional: remove files (deleting object and executable files)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yan103/Quadratic-equation
```
